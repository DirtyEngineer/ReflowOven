By pressing the menu button it is possible to cycle through the oven settings.  Unlike previous code efforts these menu options can be changed to allow for different reflow profiles for leaded and non-leaded solder. Settings are stored in EEPROM after completely cycling through all of the settings.  The default settings are used for the Black and Decker Infrawave ovens.  You may need to adjust these settings based on your particular application.  The arrow indicates the setting that is to be changed.  The setting can be changed by pressing the plus and minus buttons on the control pad.
